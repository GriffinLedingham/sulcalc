## Gen 2

* **A combination of UPokeCenter and Crystal\_**
  * The following data was obtained through UPC with various inaccuracies
    corrected by Crystal\_ and some mechanics testing done by myself.
  * If there's a crit, use the boosted stats only if the appropriate attack
    stat has more boosts than the appropriate defense stat, otherwise use the
    unboosted stats from both pokes. Use the boosted stats if there's no crit.
  * If boosts were not ignored in the previous step, halve attack for burn.
  * Cap the stats at 999.
  * If screens are active then multiply the defenses by 2, unless stat boosts
    were ignored.
  * Multiply Special Attack by 2 for Light Ball.
  * Multiply Attack by 2 for Thick Club.
  * Divide Defense by 2 for Explosion/Self-Destruct and then floor.
  * Multiply the defenses by 1.5 and round down for untransformed
    Ditto + Metal Powder
  * If either of the appropriate attack and defense stats exceed 255, then
    divide by 4, floor, and apply bitwise-and 0xFF (discard all but the least
    significant byte).
  * Make sure both the chosen attack and defense stat are at least 1.
  * `damage = (2*5/level+2)*attack*base_power/defense/50`
    Note that we are flooring after every division.
  * Multiply damage by 1.1 and round down for Mystical Water, Miracle Seed,
    Charcoal, etc.
  * Multiply by 2 for a critical hit.
  * Cap damage at 997 and then add 2.
  * If a Water-type move is used in Sunny weather, a Fire-type move is used
    in Rainy weather, or if Solar Beam is used in Rainy weather, then divide
    damage by 2 and round down. If a Fire-type move is used in Sunny weather
    or if a Water-type move is used in Rainy Weather, then multiply damage
    by 1.5 and round down.
  * Multiply damage by 1.5 and round down for STAB.
  * Multiply for type effectiveness and round down.
  * Apply damage variation 217/255 through 255/255 rounded down. Reversal and
    Flail do not have damage variation applied to them.
  * Multiply damage by 2 for switching out of Pursuit.
