      <p>
        sulcalc can calculate a lot of cool things in all generations of Pokemon
        including ORAS, SM, and even older gens like RBY and GSC. Unfortunately,
        it can't do that without Javascript enabled.

          I pinky promise it doesn't do anything bad. It downloads some files so
          you can use it offline and so you don't have to download everything
          everytime you load the > 1 MB app (wow, this is pretty big!). It also
          saves your preferences locally.
